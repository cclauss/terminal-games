------------- Welcome to the game, Hangman! -------------

Hangman is a game where one player thinks of a word,
phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it
by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes,
representing each letter of the word.

The computer will inform you how long the word is.
In each round you will be able to enter one letter
as a guess. You will be shown how many letters are
available for you to guess. If you win the game,
the computer will calculate the number of points.
If you wish to play multiple games, the points
will accumulate.

------------------------- HINTS -------------------------

There is a special symbol which you can type to get
the hint. You have 3 warnings to find out which symbol
it is. You will only have one chance for calling the
hint so make sure you call it at an appropriate time.

EXAMPLE: For "a_ _ l_" the hints will be:

Possible word matches are:
addle adult agile aisle amble ample amply amyls angle
ankle apple apply aptly arils atilt

------------------ RULES FOR THE GAME ------------------

• At the start of each game you will be given
  6 guesses and 3 warnings.
